#  Expense Era
## Description
Expense Era allows users to track their expenses in real-time, create smart budgeting plans, and securely manage their money with built-in automation features. The application streamlines the process of managing and recording expenses, providing users with the insights they need to optimize their spending.

To build this project, I utilized a diverse stack of technologies and frameworks. My back-end is powered by Spring Boot with Hibernate and JPA (Java Persistence API) for efficient database interaction. For the database, I used MySQL to handle and store relational data. The front-end is developed using React, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface, styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern and clean design. These technologies work together to ensure optimal performance, scalability, and user experience.
